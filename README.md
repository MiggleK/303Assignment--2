A try and catch block is attatched to the 2 functions requested in the instruction document. The code is identical to Assignment 1, except for this change. The try and catch blocks start at the most common error, and work there way down to the "catch all" block.

The code is changed through a constructor passed down to the derived classes from the base class. This constructor initilizes all of the attributes of both the professional and nonprofessional employee. (Since a nonprofessional has no salary and no set vacation days, these values are initilized to 0). The print statements are simply using what the class functions are returning, which for professional and nonprofessional are different based on the rules outlined in the instruction document, with slight creativity where it was open to it.
